P1 Task 1 - Draw Your Initials
==============================

.. note:: When finished, submit the iRobot project code of your solution in Moodle

The goal of this task is to draw your initials. So for example “Robert Valner” would be drawn as “RV”, just like in 
figure 1. If you have more than 3 names then let’s try to do it with just 3, so that “Robert Arthur Billy 
Valner Junior” would be “RVJ”.

This task is meant to get you warmed up if you didn’t try out the tutorial examples on your own. Additionally this 
task allows us (the supervisors) to somehow acknowledge that it was likely “YOU” who did the tasks. But we’re all here 
to learn, so try to solve the tasks independently.
