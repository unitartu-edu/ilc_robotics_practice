P2 Exercise 1 - Introduction
============================

.. note:: Practice 2 is optional. You don't have to do it if you don't feel like it. But its way more challenging and hence fun

In this practice we are going to kick the difficulty up a notch and switch the simulation environment. The simulation 
itself is based on `Webots <https://cyberbotics.com/>`_ simulator that is hosted on `robotbenchmark.net <https://robotbenchmark.net/>`_. 
Robotbenchmark has created a list of challenges, where the fist two ("Viewpoint Control" and "Robot Programming") just 
introduce the environment. So let's have a look.
