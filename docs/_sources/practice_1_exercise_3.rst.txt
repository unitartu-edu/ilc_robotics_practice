P1 Exercise 3 - Conditional
===========================

Conditionals are all about making decisions in your robot’s code. Conditional statements, such as “if this is true then ...” 
usually evaluate an expression, such as “if this task is finished, then …” or in short ``this_task == finished``. Or you could 
evaluate something numerical, such as ``nr_of_tasks_done < nr_of_all_tasks`` (read: number of tasks done is smaller than the 
number of all the tasks). So at the end of the day, all a conditional statement cares about is whether the expression evaluates 
to ``true`` or ``false``. Figure 3 shows an example where given a boolean variable, the conditional ends up rotating 
the robot right or left.
