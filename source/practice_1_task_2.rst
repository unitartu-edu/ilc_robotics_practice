P1 Task 2 - Draw a Grid Of Rectangles
=====================================

.. note:: When finished, submit the iRobot project code of your solution in Moodle

Make the robot draw a grid of rectangles (see the figure 2a-c). The dimension of the grid (rows and columns) must 
be changeable through variables (figure 2a), i.e., the code is able to draw grids of arbitrary dimensions like 
2x2, 2x7, 5x3, etc (figure 2b and 2c). You are free to choose your drawing technique, which may be more 
efficient than one shown in figure 2. If you’re stuck then the “nested loop” and “variables” exercises might 
provide you some guidance.
